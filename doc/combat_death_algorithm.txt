current implementation:


attack happens
attack damage is marked

while there are any dying minions in play:  // health <= 0 but not marked dead yet

    for each minion in play:
        mark death if necessary
        add to death event queue if necessary
    end for

    while the death event queue is not empty:
        get the next minion from the queue
        broadcast that minion's death event  // this can cause damage to other minions, but they won't be added to the death event queue yet
    end while                                // minions are added to the deathrattle queue in handle_event

    while the deathrattle queue is not empty:
        get the next minion from the queue
        resolve that minion's deathrattle  // this can cause damage to other minions, but they won't be added to the death event queue yet
    end while

end while
